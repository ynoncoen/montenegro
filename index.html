        <li><strong>Bookings:</strong> Reserve rafting and ziplining ahead of time—late May/early June is the start of peak season.</li>
        <li><strong>Weather:</strong> Bring swimwear and sunscreen for the coast, plus jackets for the cooler northern mountains.</li>
        <li><strong>Costs:</strong> Plan for car rental, accommodations, activities (roughly €75-100 per person for rafting and ziplining), and meals.</li>
        <li><strong>Food:</strong> Sample Montenegrin cuisine—burek, fresh fish, and local wines are must-tries.</li>
